          You watch “What? Where? When?” Yeah. 
          Our founders used to play it. 
          That’s where they got a question 
          about a famous American author and 
          screenwriter Ray Bradbury. Albeit, 
          our CEO Gaga Darsalia forgot the exact 
          name and he answered Ray Redberry. And at 
          that moment, a name for a yet to be born 
          company was inspired - Redberry 😇
